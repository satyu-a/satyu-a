I used to work as a web developer, but over time I found myself getting more interested in the security side of thingsâ€”how systems are protected, how attackers think, and how to defend against them.

Now Iâ€™m transitioning into cybersecurity, learning and building along the way.  ðŸš€

"**Ex-web dev, now chasing cyber threats instead of bugs.**"

## Objective

I am specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

This GitHub repo is where Iâ€™ll be sharing projects, experiments, and notes from my journey. Still a coder at heart, just pointing my skills in a new direction.
